DiscordMessageAPI


API Returns a JSON of messages with user information included.

messages.py is a cog, you may need to modify it to work with your bot, mine is just to show you how to do it.

example.db is an example database containing data you can use to test.


In both API.php & messages.py the path to the db will need to be set.
